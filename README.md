On Linux, copy the `.navcon` files to
`~/.local/share/unvanquished/game/maps`.

TODO: Add instructions for Windows and MacOS. Both have the
`game/maps` directory somewhere in the directory tree. The `.navcon`
files must be copied in this directory. You can search for `.navMesh`
files, some of these are allready in the very same directory.
